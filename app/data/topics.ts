This is where your journey begins.\n\n## What is C++?\nC++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.\n\nC++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.\n\n### Why Use C++?\n* C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.\n* C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.\n* C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.\n* C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.\n* C++ is fun and easy to learn!\n\n[Next: Variables & Types](/topics/variables-types)",
    "variables-types": "# Variables & Types\n\nIn C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:\n\n* `int` - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123\n* `double` - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99\n* `char` - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes\n* `string` - stores text, such as \"Hello World\". String values are surrounded by double quotes\n* `bool` - stores values with two states: true or false\n\n```cpp\nint myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)\ndouble myFloatNum = 5.99;    // Floating point number\nchar myLetter = 'D';         // Character\nstring myText = \"Hello\";     // String\nbool myBoolean = true;       // Boolean\n```",
    "control-flow": "# Control Flow\n\nC++ supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:\n\n* Less than: `a < b`\n* Less than or equal to: `a <= b`\n* Greater than: `a > b`\n* Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`\n* Equal to: `a == b`\n* Not Equal to: `a != b`\n\nYou can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.\n\n## If ... Else\n\n```cpp\nif (condition) {\n  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true\n}\n```",
    "functions": "# Functions\n\nA function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.\n\nYou can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.\n\nFunctions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.\n\n```cpp\nvoid myFunction() {\n  // code to be executed\n}\n```",
    // Add other topics placeholders...
